Hey Carolyn,

Here is some explanation on how some of this stuff works.. 

## Navigation ##

The Navigation on the right side of a desktop view.(Not visible on mobile devices)
If you change any of the heading of any of the sections the navigation will automatically change to the new heading. 



## Content ##
Changing the content should be pretty straight forward.

I am using HTML Character Code
http://designerstoolbox.com/designresources/html/



## Contact ##

In the content/script folder, open the index.php file.
On Line 15 you can replace the e-mail address in there to where you would like the contact form to send the information. 


In the content/thanks folder, open the index.php file.
After someone fills out the form properly they will be sent to this thank you page.
Feel fee to change the content to say anything you would like in here. 

In the content/?error folder, open the index.php file.
If someone fails to fill out the contact form properly. (Such as a bad e-mail address)
This page looks the same as the home page EXCEPT at the very beginning of the contact form shows an error message. 



Feel free to test these option's out as much as you would like.
